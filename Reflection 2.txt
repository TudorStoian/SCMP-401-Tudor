Reflection 2

Since the last time I have made strides in understanding how the existing implementation is structured. It became marginally easier after seeing a bit more of the
documentation, although that came at the cost of finding out I was being misled by the names of the various parts, and at times outright lied to.


Most importantly, I have begun work on a way to abstract my existing code. Currently I have made a function that can specify the dataset
the statistic we are interested in, as well as the other relevant parameters (number of bootstrap replications, B, and significance level).
Currently the implementation gives the percentile confidence interval. Next I will implement the other types of confidence interval.

One of the more interesting challenges ahead is incorporating one of the suggestions from the audience, that my program run a behind the scenes
analysis, to see if the default is appropriate to the dataset at hand. I have some ideas of tests to run, but not a 100% clear implementation plan.
