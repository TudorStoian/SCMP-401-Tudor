Reflection III

Since last time I have made good progress in making a general wrapper for the bootstrap. Currently, it supports one and two sample problems,(with the option of paired
or unpaired in the latter case), and allows the user to make up the relevant statistical method on the fly. There is one bug that I have to look into, in the form
of a significance level higher than 0.98 not generating a corresponding confidence interval.

One of the bigger technical questions is being able to take in and process an arbitrary number of samples. This is a problem of me not understanding the necessary
architecture in R, but hopefully it's solvable. The other big task is to actually put all of this into an R package, which is more complicated than it seemed, requiring
a C++ compiler, for instance.
